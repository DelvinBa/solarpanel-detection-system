This project aims to leverage machine learning (ML) to detect solar panels from satellite images, detecting BAG/Housing ID. To ensure scalability, reproducibility, and efficiency, an end-to-end MLOps pipeline will be implemented.

## 1 Background and Context  
The NOWATT project aims to accelerate the energy transition and mitigate grid congestion by promoting energy-neutral neighborhoods. This initiative integrates multiple stakeholders, including residents, SMEs, and government agencies, to optimize energy efficiency through AI-driven solutions.  

A key aspect of this project is leveraging artificial intelligence to categorize homes and residents, enabling personalized sustainability recommendations and district-level planning. One of the major factors influencing a home's energy efficiency rating is the presence of solar panels, as they significantly impact a building’s energy label score.  

By 2030, all rental properties in the Netherlands must have an energy label of at least D. Housing associations and landlords will need to take sustainability measures to comply with these regulations. Nijhuis Bouw, an organization specializing in sustainable housing solutions, is particularly interested in automating the assessment of energy efficiency to streamline this transition.  

To support this, our project focuses on developing an automated solar panel detection system that processes satellite and aerial images. This tool will integrate with public datasets such as Kadaster to enhance energy label predictions, helping stakeholders make informed decisions on housing sustainability.  

## 2 Problem Statement  
Manually identifying solar panels from aerial and satellite imagery is time-consuming and inefficient. Automating this process with machine learning can significantly improve accuracy and scalability.  

This project addresses two key challenges:  
1. **Solar Panel Detection**: Developing a machine learning model that can determine whether a given house in an image has solar panels.  
2. **BAG ID Retrieval**: Linking the detected solar panel data to the correct house using the BAG ID system, a unique identifier for each building in the Netherlands.  

To achieve this, we will **design and implement a complete data and machine learning pipeline**, ensuring the automation of **data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and deployment**. The pipeline will be designed for seamless integration into existing sustainability assessment systems used by Nijhuis Bouw.  

The model will be trained using **satellite images from South Germany**, where solar panel density is high. However, in production, it needs to analyze **Google Maps images of houses in the Netherlands**, requiring robust generalization across different data sources.  

Additionally, the results should ideally be integrated into the broader **energy labeling pipeline** to support sustainability assessments for housing associations and policymakers.

## 5 Project Artifacts & Handover Documents
Since the project started in the past, we got some documents and artifacts we can work with. Here is a list of things we got:
