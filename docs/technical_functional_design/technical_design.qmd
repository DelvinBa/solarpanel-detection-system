# 1. Introduction



# 2. Constraints
- **Technical constraints**: Hardware, software, cloud providers.
- **Regulatory & Compliance**: GDPR, AI ethics, data security.
- **Operational constraints**: Budget, team skills, deadlines.

# 3. System Scope and Context
- **Scope**: Define what is included/excluded in the project.
- **Context Diagram**: Illustrate data sources, models, and outputs.

# 4. Solution Strategy
- **Data pipeline strategy**: Batch vs. real-time.
- **ML model strategy**: Pre-trained vs. custom models.
- **Deployment strategy**: On-premises, cloud, or edge.
- **Scaling strategy**: Horizontal vs. vertical scaling.

# 5. Building Block View
- **Components Overview**:
  - Data ingestion
  - Data preprocessing
  - Feature engineering
  - Model training
  - Model evaluation
  - Model deployment
- **Component Diagram**: Visualize these blocks and their interactions.

# 6. Runtime View
- **Data flow**: How data moves through the system.
- **Model serving process**: How predictions are generated and served.
- **Monitoring & logging**: Performance tracking and debugging.

# 7. Deployment View
- **Infrastructure choices**: Cloud services, local servers.
- **CI/CD pipeline for ML models**.
- **Containerization strategy**: Docker, Kubernetes.
- **Versioning & rollback mechanisms**.

# 8. Cross-cutting Concepts
- **Security & Access Control**.
- **Data Governance & Lineage**.
- **MLOps Best Practices**.
- **Bias & Fairness Considerations**.

# 9. Architecture Decisions
- **ADR (Architecture Decision Records)**
  - Choice of model framework
  - Database selection
  - API design choices
  - Model versioning policy

# 10. Quality Requirements
- **Model Performance Metrics**.
- **Scalability & Maintainability**.
- **Explainability & Interpretability**.
- **Fault tolerance & disaster recovery**.

# 11. Risks and Technical Debt
- **Potential biases in data and models**.
- **Computational cost and resource constraints**.
- **Integration challenges with existing systems**.

# 12. Glossary
- Define key terms related to ML, AI, and MLOps.
