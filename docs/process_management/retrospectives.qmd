With retrospectives and the documentation of them we try to continuously improve the process and functioning of the team using concrete traceable improvement actions every iteration. 
Altough we have Iteration Cycles of 1 week, we decided to retrospective every two weeks, to have more time for development, since short project time of 10 weeks.
